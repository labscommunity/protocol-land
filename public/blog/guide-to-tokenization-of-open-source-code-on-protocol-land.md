## Guide to Tokenization of Open Source Code on Protocol.Land

Many crypto projects claim to be decentralized, their fundamental code infrastructure often isn't. Decentralization is not binary; it exists along a spectrum, as different aspects of a system ranging from code hosting to governance to deployment can each have varying degrees of decentralization. Protocol Land is positioning itself at the far end of this spectrum by creating verifiably decentralized codebases. The goal is to achieve true decentralization to the code level, not just the application level, in order to create an environment where developers can publish valuable open source code and be rewarded for its ongoing impact. But how is this achieved with Protocol.Land’s new tokenization feature?

  

## Fair Forks

Fair forking presents a different approach from most crypto projects. While most rely on DAOs and voting systems to make decisions, fair forking follows the original blockchain philosophy of social consensus. In a fair fork system, instead of needing formal votes, people can independently make changes they think are valuable and then let the community naturally gravitate toward the best solutions. This introduces non-coercive upgrades where users can choose which fork to follow, while providing clear incentives for developers to improve protocols through reward mechanisms.

## Methods of Minting

***Curve Bonded Token Model***

No one—not even the founders—gets tokens at the beginning.

  

Tokens are minted through a bonding curve, meaning the price increases mathematically as more tokens are created. Project owners set their desired market cap milestone, and upon reaching it deploy their accumulated liquidity from the bonding curve to Botega DEX with a single click, enabling open-market trading. This creates a natural evolution from early growth to mature trading.

Most crypto projects start with pre-allocated tokens, creating immediate conflicts between early holders and new buyers. This model removes that issue entirely: everyone—from project creators to early supporters to later investors—participates on the same terms. The bonding curve ensures early supporters get better prices, achieved through mathematics rather than special allocations.

  

## **What does this mean for crypto?**

This feature represents two fundamental shifts in how open source code creates and captures value.

  

Protocol.Land enables the market to naturally select valuable improvements without needing a governance system. Developers propose changes through fair forks, and the community signals support through speculation on repository tokens. This setup creates a direct economic feedback loop that rewards beneficial changes, streamlining improvement processes.

  

For the first time, open source developers and contributors can be fairly compensated for the full value their code provides to the community. Protocol.Land’s tokenization feature creates a direct link between a project’s utility and the rewards its creators receive. This aligns incentives across the entire development lifecycle, from initial creation through ongoing improvements.

  

This model is heavily inspired by [The Framework for Evolving Arweave](http://arweave.net/qyAI9xZfI6gbp4UixqtSMWiIY3F0L2QB-yniVTExESY) and the [Fair Forks](http://arweave.net/loJ6EmO_2pTA313k3KtXEyrmCtCTJ5ThZMcPtNxX0m4) paper.
